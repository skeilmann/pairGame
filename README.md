simple game to train my JS skills
All the workflow iyu can see in commits on the gitlab server https://gitlab.skillbox.ru/gheorghe_cazacu/JS.git
This is because for learning purpouse Skillbox company (the comapny where i bought my courses) use gitlab instead of github.

main idea is to make a simple memory game. 
I added some elemnts for my own to make interactions more user friendly.
Plan toa add and other functionality later, such us choosing by user (player - say as you want)) how much time he want a round to have.
